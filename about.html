                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am Charl Nick Laurente, a second-year college student from Ormoc City, Leyte, currently studying at Eastern Visayas State University. I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can transform lives and industries. As an aspiring developer, I am focused on learning and improving my skills in various areas, including web development, programming, and design. My passion lies in problem-solving, and I strive to create innovative, efficient, and user-friendly solutions that make a positive impact. Whether it’s working on a simple website or developing a complex system, I enjoy the challenge of turning an idea into something real and functional. In addition to my studies, I am also an entry-level photographer, specializing in portrait and wedding photography, which allows me to explore my creative side. By blending my technical skills with creativity, I aim to contribute to the digital world in meaningful ways. I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow, learn, and collaborate with others. My goal is to develop my expertise further, work with like-minded individuals, and eventually take on projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible in technology and design. I look forward to the journey ahead and the endless possibilities it holds.</p>
